# diceydungeonsbeta
Issue tracker for the private Dicey Dungeons beta. For issues in the public alpha, see https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/diceydungeons.github.io

I've made this repo public for ease of access. Beware of spoilers!

Thanks for all the contributions over the course of the beta (and halloween special) <3. My plan is now to effectively merge this repo with the main public one, closing issues here that have a similar enough issue already on main and closing issues that are either already address or not planned at this point. The closed issues will remain here for future reference!
